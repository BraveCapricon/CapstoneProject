Coursera_Project
The project background is working for SpaceY fictitious rocket company to compare with SpaceX company.
SpaceX gained popularity as of December 2010 after being the 1st private company to ever return a spacecraft from low earth orbit 
SpaceX is more advanced and cheaper than other rocket companies since the cost of the 1st stage of its rocket launch using Falcon 9 ($ 62 million) is much cheaper than that of other companies ($ 165 million).
The project objective is to predict using Machine Learning (instead of rocket science) whether the 1st stage of the launch can be reused. 
This will enable company SpaceY to be able to bid against SpaceX
